I had trouble getting one and when I did, I was told that the software wasn't good because it came on a small installation disk that was prone to damage during transportation. I bought one anyway and came to the Internet to look for a driver. Since it is a generic unit, I couldn't find the manufacturer and therefore couldn't get the driver from the most trusted source. I had to comb through several forum conversations to find a decent driver. I almost installed a virus too.

So I created this repo hoping that it will be helpful to anyone who needs the driver. Cheers.
